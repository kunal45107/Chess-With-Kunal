A draggable Chessboard UI built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Pieces can be moved freely and captured, just like on a physical board.

No game rules or move validation yet — this is a **UI-only project**, and as I learn more in full-stack development, I plan to add logic, AI, multiplayer, and more!

## 🎨 Custom Chess Piece Designs

All the chess pieces used in this project were **designed by me using Figma**.  
This allowed for full creative control over the look and consistency of the UI.

Here's a preview of the designs:
